In the reservoir simulation community, the main focus of research related to \textit{Numerical Linear Algebra}, 
is to develop a physics-based preconditioner that can be efficiently coupled to a well-known high
performing Krylov-type iterative solver. This is due to the fact that the performance of these
solvers can significantly depend on the preconditioning of the matrix. Usually, preconditioning
is a mixture of experience, art and science and requires a domain specific knowledge of the problem
being solved. The industry-standard, state-of-the-art preconditioner is the Constrained Pressure Residual.
This report presents results related to the implementation of CPR on UTCOMP-RS\footnote{University Of Texas Compositional-Reservoir Simulator.}.
