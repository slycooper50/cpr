\chapter{Overview Of Constrained Pressure Residual}

The equations describing fluid flow in porous media are coupled nonlinear PDEs that can be written in descritized
residual form as follows\supercite{opmflow}:
\begin{equation}
	R_{\alpha,i} = \frac{\phi_{i}V_{i}}{\Delta t} (A_{\alpha,i} - A^{0}_{\alpha,i}) + \sum_{j\in C(i)} u_{\alpha,ij} + q_{\alpha,i} = 0
	\label{res_bal}
\end{equation}

The subscripts, $\alpha$ and $i, j$, refers to phase and gridblock respectively. The terms that 
constitute the residual are the acumulation term, $A$, the flux term, $u$, and the source or sink term,
$q$. These terms are functions of the primary variables. The \textit{primary variables} differ based on 
selected formulation of the flow phenomena. A usual selection, refered to as the \textit{natural variables}, is
$p$, $S_{o}$, $S_{g}$ and $x_{c}$ or $y_{c}$ (component $c$ mole fraction in oil or gas phase). Based on \textit{Gibbs phase rule}, 
only $n_{c}$ (number of components variables) are needed to describe the physical system\supercite{cao}. The equations and variables selected
in the solution are refered to as the \textit{primary} equations and variables, the others are refered to as \textit{secondary} equations and variables. 

The efficiency of the linear solver depends on the nature of variables. For hyperbolic systems the \textit{ILU} and \textit{Gauss-Seidel} works well, for
elliptic systems the \textit{AMG} is more efficent. Since the equations of reservoir simulation are of mixed character, near-hyperbolic in saturation and
near-elliptic in pressure, a decoupling technique must be deviced to precondition each subsystem accordingly. The decoupling technique that solves a pressure
subsystem first and then combines the pressure guess in the residual with the remaining near-hyperbolic variables is refered to as \textit{Constrained Pressure Residual} preconditioner.

\section{The Nonlinear Equations Of Reservoir Simulation}

Equation \ref{res_bal}, is refered to as a phase balance (component balance if a compositional formulation is used) relation . It is supplamented by
additional constraints equations to complete the system of equations (ensure number of varialbes is equal to number of equations). These constraint
equations can be, $\sum_{\alpha}S_{\alpha} = 1$, where  $S_{\alpha}$ is saturatoin of phase $\alpha$, or $f_{\alpha,i} = f_{\beta,i}$, where $f_{\alpha,i}$
is the fugacity of component $i$ in phase $\alpha$ (for compositional formulations). 
The general form of the nonlinear equations of reservoir simulation can be expressed as\supercite{roy}:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial\mathbf{M}}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} + \mathbf{Q}
	\label{nonlineq}
\end{equation}
Where the vector field $\mathbf{M}$ represents mass of the system, $\mathbf{F}$ represents cross flow contributions and $\mathbf{Q}$ represents source/sink terms.
In its continuous form the equation \ref{nonlineq} with its vector components of each variable, $\mathbf{M}$, $\mathbf{F}$ and $\mathbf{Q}$ can be representing a mass balance 
for each hydrocarbon component plus water, while the other vectors will be flow contribution (Darcy's law substitution) of each component plus water and $\mathbf{Q}$ 
vector components are source/sink terms of each component plus water. Hence, the length of each vector field is $N_{c} + 1$. Where, $N_{c}$ is the number of hydrocarbon components.
A detailed description of different physical models to simulate fluid flow in porous media can be found in many resources in the literature, a good starting point is \cite{cao,aziz}.
Possible values for these vector fields are given below:

\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{M} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	\phi\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}S_{p}x_{1,p} \\
	\phi\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}S_{p}x_{2,p} \\
	\vdots\\
	\phi\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}S_{p}x_{i,p} \\
	\vdots\\
	\phi\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}S_{p}x_{N_{c}+1,p} 
\end{pmatrix}
,\mathbf{F} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}x_{1,p}\frac{kk_{rp}}{\mu_{p}}(\nabla p_{p}-\rho_{p}g\nabla d)\\
	\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}x_{2,p}\frac{kk_{rp}}{\mu_{p}}(\nabla p_{p}-\rho_{p}g\nabla d)\\
	\vdots\\
	\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}x_{i,p}\frac{kk_{rp}}{\mu_{p}}(\nabla p_{p}-\rho_{p}g\nabla d)\\
	\vdots\\
	\sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}\rho_{p}x_{N_{c} + 1,p}\frac{kk_{rp}}{\mu_{p}}(\nabla p_{p}-\rho_{p}g\nabla d)\\
\end{pmatrix}
,\mathbf{Q} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	Q_{1}\\
	Q_{2}\\
	\vdots\\
	Q_{i}\\
	\vdots\\
	Q_{N_{c}+1}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The dependant variables in this system of PDEs can also be assigned differently based on the model selected. However, one possible selection which usually refered to as natural variables selection\supercite{cao} is: 
pressure $p$, saturations $S_{p}$ and mole fractions $x_{i}$. From a thermodynamic point of view, the Gibbs phase rule fixes the number variables needed to describe the physical system. This number is $N_{c} + 1$, that is
number of hydrocarbon components plus one\supercite{cao}. Moreover, further constitutive relations must be satisfied in cases where multiple phases are present or capillary pressure and fugacities must be accounted for in
compositional models. These equations are refered to as secondary equations, since their variables depend on the primary variables selected in the $N_{c} + 1$ system. Some of these secondary equations can be written as follows:

\begin{equation}
	R_{cap} = P_{c,ow} - (p_{o} - p_{w}) = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	R_{fug} = f_{i,o} - f_{i,g} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	R_{sat} = \sum_{p=1}^{N_{p}}S_{p} - 1 = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	R_{frac} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_{c}}x_{i} - 1 = 0
\end{equation}

\section{Newton's Method As A Nonlinear Solver}
The standard method to solve the discretized form of the nonlinear PDEs is the Newton-Raphson method. This method 
will converge, provided the derivative of the function is not equal to zero at the initial guess, in at least
a quadratic rate. The Method can be written for a system of equations as follows:
\begin{equation}
J_{R}(\mathbf{x_{n}})(\mathbf{x_{n+1} - x_{n}}) = -F(\mathbf{x_{n}})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	Ax = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	A_{pp} & A_{ps}\\
	A_{sp} & A_{ss}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	x_{p} \\
	x_{s}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
	b_{p} \\
	b_{s}
\end{bmatrix}
=
b
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Jacobian Matrix}
During the early stages of running a simulator, there has to be part of the software responsible for
building what's refered to as a connectivity graph. The connectivity graph is an essential data structure used
when constructing the jacobian matrix. It basically contains information about which gridblock variables will effect
another gridblock variables. That is which gridblock is connected to which gridblock. This information depends on the
way gridblocks are ordered and numbered. It also depends on whether the simulation model contains non-neighboring connections
like wells or fractures. It also depends on the dimensionality of the simulation model. For an example of a jacobian matrix for a 
simple one dimensional simulation grid with no unusual connections see figure \ref{jacobian}.

\resizebox{9.5cm}{!}{\input{tikz/jacobian.tikz}}
\caption{Example of a Jacobian matrix constructed for three components one dimensional problem.}
\label{jacobian}
\end{figure}
Since we are solving a system of nonlinear PDEs with more than one variable being solved for, each entry of the matrix is a block of size
$n_{eq}\times n_{eq}$. For fully-implicit systems the block size is usually $n_{comp}\times n_{comp}$.

\section{Decoupling Techniques}
The CPR procedure can be summarized by the following two steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Extract a pressure subsystem by a decoupling operator.
	\item Precondition the original system after modifying the pressure guess from the first step.
\end{itemize}
The decoupling process is an essential step in reducing the coupling between the pressure and the other variables.
The effectiveness of the preconditioner will vary based on the decoupling technique used. Therefore, in the research
literature on CPR preconditioner, there are a variety of decoupling techniques that each will result in a different pressure
subsystem and therefore different solution times. Preconditioners that results from the application of two linear operators
$P_{1}^{-1}$ and $P_{2}^{-1}$ are refered to as two-stage preconditioners. In general, if matrix $A$ is the original jacobian
matrix of the system, a two stage preconditioner can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	P^{-1} = P_{2}^{-1}(I-AP_{1}^{-1}) + P_{1}^{-1}
\end{equation}
In particular, the CPR preconditioner can be written as:
\begin{equation}
	M_{CPR}^{-1} = M^{-1}(I - AC(W^{T}AC)^{-1}W^{T}) + C(W^{T}AC)^{-1}W^{T}
\end{equation}
The decoupling techniques for CPR are summarized in table \ref{dectec} and expounded in below sections.

\subsection{Quasi-Implicit Pressure Explicit Saturation (QIMPES)}
This decoupling technique was first introduced in \cite{IPARSdecoupling}. It is inspired by the famous IMPEC formulation as imlemented by Coats in \cite{impescoats}.
In this decoupling technique, there are three main assumptions made with regards to the system being solved:
\begin{assumption}
	The solution vector is ${Y_{j}}, \ (j=1,...,n+m)$. With $Y_{1}$, referring to the pressure variable, and the remaining variables being
	saturations or concentrations.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}
	When the jacobian matrix $A$ is constructed with gridblock ordering, the off-diagonal blocks are negligible.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}
	For the following system of equations:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			A_{p}&A_{ps}\\
			A_{sp}&A_{s}
		\end{pmatrix} 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			Y_{p}\\
			Y_{s}
		\end{pmatrix} 
		= 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			Z_{p}\\
			Z_{s}
		\end{pmatrix} 
	\end{align}
	If $\tilde{Y}_{p}$ and $\tilde{A}_{s}$ are good approximations of $Y_{p}$ and $A_{s}$ respectively,
	then $(\tilde{Y}_{p}, \tilde{A}_{s}^{-1}(Z_{s}-A_{sp}\tilde{Y}_{p}))^{T}$ is a good approximation of $(Y_{p}, Y_{s})^{T}$.
\end{assumption}

The matrix $A$ is the resulting matrix after a Schur Complement to reduce the size to $n_{c}\times n_{c}$, by eliminating the constraints equations.
Note that in the original paper of QIMPES, the algorithm is reduced to preconditioning of the pressure subsystem only. The typical two-stage preconditioning
(saturation with pressure corrected) is refered there as \textit{Combinative Technique}. These combinative techniques rely on a feedback from the pressure preconditioner
and produce a guess that accounts for pressure-saturation interaction.

\subsection{Alternate Block Factorization (ABF)}
This method was introduced firstly in the semi-conductors simulation industry in 1989\supercite{Bank1989}. Like other decoupling strategies the
Alternate Block Factorization goal is to reduce the coupling between variables in the system. The researchers differentiates between two kinds
of coupling. The first is refered to as \textit{intra-grid}, the other is \textit{intra-equation}. The intra-grid is the coupling between 
variables that results from the discretization of differential equations being solved on a spatial domain with a definite grid connectivity.
The intra-equation, is the coupling between variables that results from the physics of the coupled system of PDEs.
The stronger the coupling between variables the more efficient decoupling techniques will be on solving the problem than other methods.
The first to apply the ABF method in reservoir simulation is Klie, et al\supercite{klie}, in their investigations of two-stage preconditioners. 
In the original paper of ABF decoupling technique, the authors assume a system of $m$ coupld PDEs in a mesh of size $\nu$.
