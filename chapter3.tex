\chapter{Implementation In UTCOMPRS}
The preconditioner module developed in the compositional simulator \texttt{UTCOMPRS}, follows a
decoupling technique similar to the technique in the \texttt{INTERSECT IX}, the next \textit{SLB}
generation of reservoir simulators. The details of the CPR implementation in \texttt{INTERSECT IX}
are presented in \cite{ix-cpr}. The CPR preconditioner in \texttt{UTCOMPRS} is developed as a customized
\texttt{PETSC} preconditioner, since \texttt{UTCOMPRS} is using \texttt{PETSC} Krylov-based iterators 
for the linear solution of resulting system of equations. During the \texttt{FGMRES} cycle of \texttt{PETSC}, 
the customized preconditioner is called and the decoupling of the pressure equation is performed. \texttt{PETSC}
provides an interface to the \texttt{hypre} library of fast preconditioners and AMG solvers\supercite{hypre}.
The AMG solver \texttt{BoomerAMG}\supercite{boomeramg}, is used to solve the pressure subsystem. The second stage
of the preconditioner consists of combining the pressure solution from AMG with the secondary variables to apply
a global \texttt{ILU(0)} preconditioning on the system as a whole. 

The decoupling is performed by looping over the main diagonal sub-blocks of the jacobian matrix 
and inverting them to build the decoupling operator. In \texttt{UTCOMPRS}, the inversion
of the block entries along the diagonal is performed using a direct solver, LU factorization, 
from the \texttt{LAPACK} library. A summary of the CPR algorithm in \texttt{UTCOMPRS} is shown in \ref{utcompcpr}.
